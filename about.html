		<h2 class="lead">Dianne's Story</h2>
		<p style="text-align: left;">
					In April 2004, Dianne and her fiancé John vacationed 
					in Las Vegas. A few days later, John started 
					complaining of lower back pain. They thought he 
					pulled a muscle when he grabbed the luggage off 
					the carousel in the airport. The pain continued 
					throughout the entire trip, so John made an 
					appointment with his doctor. He saw his doctor 
					and a couple other doctors, but they could not figure 
					out what was wrong. His primary doctor decided he 
					should have a MRI taken. The results came back; 
					there was a spot on his liver. Still unsure, the doctor 
					ordered a biopsy. On May 1, 2004, the results came 
					back. Stage IV Pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer 
					is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related 
					deaths in the United States and the eighth worldwide. 
					Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor prognosis.
					</p>
					
		<p style="text-align: left;">
					Chemotherapy was started immediately and very 
					aggressively. John’s family lived in another part of the 
					state and owned and operated a business, so they 
					were unable to come to Virginia Beach to help him. 
					With no one else to help, Dianne stepped into a 
					daunting task of becoming a Primary Caregiver. At 
					that time,  she held a full time job, when to school full 
					time and had two children in school. John moved in 
					with her and her family, and the journey began, 
					accompanying him on his doctor visits, taking him to his 
					treatments and procedures. It is very difficult to see the 
					one you love, once vibrant, energetic and full of life 
					transform into someone who refused to eat, always 
					in pain, tired and lethargic from the treatments. John 
					lost his battle with cancer on September 26, 2004. 
					John’s mother, up until her death in January 2013, 
					would always thank Dianne for what she did for her 
					son and called her an angel for stepping in when his 
					family could not be there to take care of him. His mother 
					told Dianne, she would always be a part of the family. 
					John’s entire family embraced her. Dianne still has a 
					wonderful relationship and an unbreakable bond 
					with John’s family and talks and visit with them regularly.

		<h2 class="lead">Nicole's Story</h2>
			
		<p style="text-align: left;">
					In September 2009, Nicole’s father was diagnosed
					with Stage IV neck and throat cancer. Because the 
					cancer was found in its final stages, he had to 
					undergo very aggressive treatments. At the time,
					Nicole was a full-time student and a full-time mother.
					Being the youngest child of her father’s many 
					children, she reached out for help with the process
					so she would be able to complete her semester in
					school. With the commitment of her siblings to
					support their father through this process, she
					began to work with the doctors to start planning. In
					preparation for his treatments, he had to have oral 
					surgery and a peg tube insertion so he would be
					able to still receive the appropriate nutrition 
					during the process as he would lose his ability to
					eat during the aggressive radiation to his neck and 
					throat.
					</p>
					
			<p style="text-align: left;">
					The journey began... and Nicole was without the
					support she needed. There were many reasons her
					siblings were not able to follow through with their
					commitments; distance, emotions, jobs, family, etc.
					However, she gave her father 100% commitment
					and her heart would not let her down. She wanted 
					him to live! The journey was tough on her father, who
					was a very prideful, strong, independent and
					normally very determined man. For her, this 
					journey was extremely painful, emotionally draining,
					physically taxing...if you’ve ever been through this
					you know exactly the effects this can have on a 
					caregiver. Nicole became a Primary Caregiver
					overnight without any training and for her dying father!
					</p>
					
			<p style="text-align: left;">
					Dianne and Nicole did not understand at the time the
					preparations they went through, but it all makes sense
					today. Dianne’s presence and commitment to John
					during his battle and the last nine months of Nicole’s
					father’s life was preparation for their dream, destiny,
					and passion. They had a passion to provide for others
					what they needed during their journey...a Helping Hand!
